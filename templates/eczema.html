    <h2>Eczema - Treatment and Recommendations</h2>
    <p style="color: red;"><strong>Note:</strong> First preference is to consult a skin doctor.</p>
    
    <h3 style="color: black;">1. Prescription Treatments for Eczema</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Topical Corticosteroids</strong>: These are the most common medications for treating eczema flare-ups. Examples include hydrocortisone and betamethasone, which help reduce inflammation and itchiness.</li>
        <li><strong>Topical Calcineurin Inhibitors</strong> (e.g., Tacrolimus, Pimecrolimus): Used as an alternative to steroids, these help reduce inflammation without the side effects of long-term steroid use.</li>
        <li><strong>Topical PDE4 Inhibitors</strong> (e.g., Crisaborole): These are non-steroidal creams that reduce inflammation and are suitable for mild eczema.</li>
        <li><strong>Moisturizers and Emollients</strong>: Regular use of thick, fragrance-free moisturizers helps maintain skin hydration and prevents flare-ups.</li>
        <li><strong>Oral Antihistamines</strong>: These can help control itching, especially at night. Antihistamines like diphenhydramine (Benadryl) can reduce the severity of itching and discomfort.</li>
        <li><strong>Oral Corticosteroids</strong>: In severe cases, a short course of oral steroids (e.g., prednisone) may be prescribed to reduce widespread inflammation.</li>
        <li><strong>Phototherapy (UVB Light Therapy)</strong>: For moderate to severe eczema, light therapy may be used to calm inflammation and improve skin health.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These treatments focus on managing flare-ups and soothing the skin.</p>

    <h3 style="color: black;">2. Diet Recommendations</h3>
    <p><strong>* Foods to Include:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Omega-3 Fatty Acids</strong>: Found in fatty fish (salmon, mackerel), flaxseeds, and walnuts, omega-3s help reduce skin inflammation and improve skin barrier function.</li>
        <li><strong>Probiotic-Rich Foods</strong>: Yogurt, kefir, and other fermented foods may help balance the gut microbiome and improve skin conditions like eczema.</li>
        <li><strong>Vitamin D-Rich Foods</strong>: Vitamin D is essential for immune function and skin health. Foods like fortified milk, eggs, and sunlight exposure can support skin healing.</li>
        <li><strong>Antioxidant-Rich Foods</strong>: Fruits and vegetables high in antioxidants (e.g., berries, spinach, carrots) help combat oxidative stress and reduce inflammation in the skin.</li>
        <li><strong>Whole Grains</strong>: Foods like oats, quinoa, and brown rice help reduce inflammation and provide steady energy, supporting overall health.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>* Foods to Avoid:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Dairy Products</strong>: Some people with eczema may find that dairy triggers flare-ups. Avoiding milk, cheese, and yogurt may help.</li>
        <li><strong>Processed Foods</strong>: High in additives and preservatives, processed foods can contribute to skin inflammation and irritation.</li>
        <li><strong>Eggs and Nuts</strong>: These are common food allergens that may worsen eczema for some individuals. If allergic, avoid these foods to reduce flare-ups.</li>
        <li><strong>Spicy and Acidic Foods</strong>: These may irritate the skin in some individuals. It's best to avoid foods like citrus fruits, tomatoes, and spicy dishes during flare-ups.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 style="color: black;">3. Clean Procedures and Hygiene</h3>
    <p><strong>Common Care and Hygiene Tips:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Moisturize Regularly</strong>: Keeping the skin well-moisturized with fragrance-free creams and ointments is crucial to prevent dryness and flare-ups.</li>
        <li><strong>Gentle Cleansing</strong>: Use a mild, fragrance-free soap and lukewarm water when bathing or showering. Avoid hot water, as it can dry out the skin and trigger eczema flare-ups.</li>
        <li><strong>Avoid Scratching</strong>: Scratching can worsen eczema by causing the skin to break and become infected. Try using a cold compress or topical treatments to relieve itching.</li>
        <li><strong>Wear Soft, Breathable Fabrics</strong>: Clothing made from cotton is gentler on the skin and reduces irritation. Avoid rough fabrics like wool that can cause further discomfort.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Mild Laundry Detergents</strong>: Fragrance-free and hypoallergenic laundry detergents reduce the risk of skin irritation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 style="color: black;">4. Lifestyle Modifications</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Reduce Stress</strong>: Emotional stress can trigger eczema flare-ups. Practices like yoga, meditation, or mindfulness can help reduce stress levels and improve skin health.</li>
        <li><strong>Keep the Skin Cool</strong>: Heat and sweating can trigger eczema flare-ups. Wear breathable clothing and stay cool, especially in hot weather.</li>
        <li><strong>Stay Hydrated</strong>: Drink plenty of water to keep the skin hydrated and maintain overall health.</li>
        <li><strong>Avoid Known Triggers</strong>: If certain substances (such as certain fabrics, soaps, or allergens) trigger your eczema, make sure to avoid them whenever possible.</li>
        <li><strong>Regular Skin Checks</strong>: Monitor your skin regularly for any signs of infection, as eczema can make the skin more susceptible to bacterial infections.</li>
    </ul>
