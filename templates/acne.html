    <h3 style="color: black;">3. Clean Procedures and Hygiene</h3>
    <p><strong>Common Care and Hygiene Tips:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Gentle Cleansing</strong>: Wash your face twice daily using a mild, non-comedogenic (wonâ€™t clog pores) cleanser to remove excess oil and dirt.</li>
        <li><strong>Avoid Scrubbing</strong>: Harsh scrubbing can irritate and inflame the skin, making acne worse.</li>
        <li><strong>Use a Non-Comedogenic Moisturizer</strong>: Even oily skin needs hydration. Choose oil-free moisturizers to avoid clogging pores.</li>
        <li><strong>Apply Sunscreen</strong>: Protect your skin daily with a non-comedogenic, oil-free sunscreen to prevent sun damage that can worsen acne.</li>
        <li><strong>Change Pillowcases Regularly</strong>: Pillowcases can accumulate oil and bacteria that may contribute to acne. Aim to change them every 2-3 days.</li>
        <li><strong>Clean Makeup Brushes</strong>: Wash your brushes weekly to remove bacteria that can transfer to your skin.</li>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Stay Hydrated</strong>: Drink plenty of water to keep your skin hydrated and flush out toxins.</li>
        <li><strong>Exercise Regularly</strong>: Physical activity can improve circulation and reduce stress, both of which can positively affect skin health.</li>

        <li><strong>Reduce Stress</strong>: Practice stress-reducing activities such as meditation, yoga, or deep breathing exercises, as stress can trigger acne.</li>
