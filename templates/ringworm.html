    <h2>Ringworm - Treatment and Recommendations</h2>
    <p style="color: red;"><strong>Note:</strong> First preference is to consult a skin doctor.</p>
    
    <h3 style="color: black;">1. Prescription Treatments for Ringworm</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Topical Antifungal Creams</strong> (e.g., Clotrimazole, Miconazole, Terbinafine): These are commonly prescribed for mild to moderate ringworm infections. Apply to the affected area as directed until the infection clears.</li>
        <li><strong>Oral Antifungal Medications</strong> (e.g., Terbinafine, Griseofulvin, Itraconazole): For severe or widespread infections, oral antifungals may be prescribed to ensure the infection is fully treated.</li>
        <li><strong>Topical Steroid-Antifungal Combinations</strong>: In some cases, a combination of antifungal treatment and a mild steroid may be prescribed to reduce inflammation associated with the infection.</li>
        <li><strong>Antifungal Shampoos</strong> (e.g., Ketoconazole, Selenium Sulfide): For scalp ringworm (tinea capitis), antifungal shampoos can be used to control the infection.</li>
    </ul>
   

    <h3 style="color: black;">2. Diet Recommendations</h3>
    <p><strong>Foods to Include:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Probiotic-Rich Foods</strong>: Foods like yogurt, kefir, and sauerkraut can help improve gut health and boost the immune system, which can aid in fighting fungal infections.</li>
        <li><strong>Garlic</strong>: Known for its antifungal and immune-boosting properties, garlic can help reduce fungal infections.</li>
        <li><strong>Zinc-Rich Foods</strong>: Zinc supports the immune system and skin healing. Foods like pumpkin seeds, beans, and lentils are good sources.</li>
        <li><strong>Vitamin C-Rich Foods</strong>: Vitamin C boosts immunity and supports skin health. Include citrus fruits like oranges, strawberries, and bell peppers.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Foods to Avoid:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Sugary Foods</strong>: Fungal infections can thrive on sugar. Avoid candy, soda, and processed foods high in refined sugar during the treatment.</li>
        <li><strong>Dairy Products</strong>: Some individuals find that dairy products can promote fungal growth. You may want to limit or avoid them during the infection.</li>
        <li><strong>Alcohol</strong>: Alcohol can weaken the immune system, making it harder for the body to fight the fungal infection.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 style="color: black;">3. Clean Procedures and Hygiene</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Clean the Area Gently</strong>: Wash the infected area with soap and water, and pat it dry. Avoid scrubbing the infection as it can irritate the skin.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Antifungal Powders or Creams</strong>: Apply antifungal treatments as directed by your doctor, usually after cleaning and drying the affected area.</li>
        <li><strong>Avoid Scratching</strong>: Ringworm can be itchy, but scratching can spread the infection to other parts of the body or others. Keep the area clean and use antifungal cream regularly.</li>
        <li><strong>Wash Clothes and Bedding Frequently</strong>: Fungus can survive on fabrics, so wash clothes, towels, and bedding regularly in hot water to prevent reinfection.</li>
        <li><strong>Keep the Area Dry</strong>: Fungi thrive in warm, moist environments. Keep the affected area dry and avoid tight clothing that may cause sweating.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 style="color: black;">4. Lifestyle Modifications</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Practice Good Hygiene</strong>: Wash your hands regularly, especially after touching the infected area, to prevent spreading the fungus.</li>
        <li><strong>Avoid Sharing Personal Items</strong>: Do not share towels, clothes, or hairbrushes to prevent spreading the infection to others.</li>
        <li><strong>Keep Skin Dry</strong>: Since fungi thrive in moist environments, wear breathable clothing and avoid tight shoes or socks that can trap moisture.</li>
        <li><strong>Boost Your Immune System</strong>: Eat a balanced diet, get regular exercise, and manage stress to help strengthen your immune system and fight the infection more effectively.</li>
        <li><strong>Avoid Contact with Infected Individuals or Animals</strong>: Ringworm can spread easily through direct contact. Avoid contact with others who have the infection and be cautious around animals that may carry it.</li>
    </ul>
