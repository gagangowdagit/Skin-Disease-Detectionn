    <p style="color: red ;"><strong>Note:</strong> First preference is to consult a skin doctor.</p>
    <h3 style="color: black;">1. Prescription Treatments for Psoriasis</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Topical Corticosteroids</strong>: These are the most common treatments for psoriasis flare-ups. Examples include hydrocortisone and betamethasone, which help reduce inflammation and control symptoms.</li>
        <li><strong>Topical Vitamin D Analogues</strong> (e.g., Calcipotriene, Calcitriol): These help slow down the rapid growth of skin cells and reduce inflammation.</li>
        <li><strong>Topical Retinoids</strong> (e.g., Tazarotene): These are used to reduce the scaling of the skin by normalizing cell production.</li>
        <li><strong>Coal Tar</strong>: This can help reduce inflammation, scaling, and itchiness. It is often used in combination with other treatments.</li>
        <li><strong>Phototherapy (UVB Light Therapy)</strong>: Exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light under medical supervision helps slow the growth of skin cells and can alleviate symptoms in moderate to severe cases.</li>
        <li><strong>Systemic Treatments</strong> (Oral or Injectable): These are prescribed for moderate to severe psoriasis and include:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Methotrexate</strong>: A drug that suppresses the immune system to reduce inflammation.</li>
                <li><strong>Acitretin</strong>: A systemic retinoid that helps slow skin cell growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Biologic Medications</strong> (e.g., Adalimumab, Etanercept): These target specific parts of the immune system involved in the inflammatory process and are usually administered via injection or infusion.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3 style="color: black;">2. Diet Recommendations</h3>
    <p><strong>* Foods to Include:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Omega-3 Fatty Acids</strong>: Found in fatty fish (salmon, mackerel), walnuts, and flaxseeds, omega-3s have anti-inflammatory properties that can help manage psoriasis symptoms.</li>
        <li><strong>Antioxidant-Rich Foods</strong>: Fruits and vegetables (e.g., berries, spinach, kale) that are rich in antioxidants help reduce inflammation and oxidative stress, supporting overall skin health.</li>
        <li><strong>Vitamin D-Rich Foods</strong>: Vitamin D plays a role in skin health. Include fortified foods (e.g., milk, cereal), eggs, and fatty fish to maintain adequate vitamin D levels.</li>
        <li><strong>Whole Grains</strong>: Foods like oats, quinoa, and brown rice help reduce inflammation and support overall health.</li>
        <li><strong>Probiotics</strong>: Yogurt, kefir, and fermented foods can improve gut health, which may reduce inflammation in the body and help manage psoriasis.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>* Foods to Avoid:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Nightshade Vegetables</strong>: Tomatoes, potatoes, peppers, and eggplants can trigger psoriasis flare-ups in some people. Itâ€™s worth tracking your symptoms to see if they affect your condition.</li>
        <li><strong>Processed Foods</strong>: Highly processed and junk foods can trigger inflammation in the body, leading to worsened psoriasis symptoms.</li>
        <li><strong>Alcohol</strong>: Excessive alcohol consumption may trigger flare-ups and interfere with psoriasis treatments.</li>
        <li><strong>Dairy Products</strong>: Some people with psoriasis find that dairy products worsen their symptoms. Avoiding milk, cheese, and other dairy products may be beneficial.</li>
        <li><strong>Sugar and Refined Carbs</strong>: Foods like candy, pastries, and white bread can increase inflammation and trigger flare-ups.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 style="color: black;">3. Clean Procedures and Hygiene</h3>
    <p><strong>Common Care and Hygiene Tips:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Moisturize Regularly</strong>: Keeping the skin hydrated is essential for managing psoriasis. Use thick, fragrance-free creams and ointments immediately after bathing to lock in moisture.</li>
        <li><strong>Gentle Cleansing</strong>: Use mild, non-soap cleansers and lukewarm water when washing. Avoid hot water, as it can dry out and irritate the skin.</li>
        <li><strong>Avoid Scratching</strong>: Scratching can lead to skin damage and increase the risk of infection. Try to control the urge by applying topical treatments or a cold compress.</li>
        <li><strong>Avoid Irritating Fabrics</strong>: Wear soft, breathable fabrics like cotton to avoid friction and irritation that can worsen psoriasis lesions.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Fragrance-Free Products</strong>: Choose fragrance-free lotions, soaps, and laundry detergents to prevent skin irritation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 style="color: black;">4. Lifestyle Modifications</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Manage Stress</strong>: Stress is a common trigger for psoriasis flare-ups. Practices like yoga, meditation, and deep breathing exercises can help reduce stress levels.</li>
        <li><strong>Regular Exercise</strong>: Exercise can help reduce inflammation and improve circulation, contributing to overall skin health.</li>
        <li><strong>Stay Hydrated</strong>: Drinking plenty of water helps keep your skin hydrated and supports overall health.</li>
        <li><strong>Protect Your Skin from Injury</strong>: Avoid cuts, scrapes, or sunburns, as injuries to the skin can trigger psoriasis flare-ups.</li>
        <li><strong>Get Enough Sleep</strong>: Sleep is important for overall health and immune function. Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep each night to support skin healing and manage symptoms.</li>
    </ul>
